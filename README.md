## Base setup for React/Redux Frontend with Webpack-Dev-Server

### Purpose

Auto refresh browser on saves.

### Why?

Because this configuration is faster than `npx create-react-app .` on my slow internet.
And, I can add whatever I need as I go along.

### Start

run `npm i`
then `npm start`
then go to `localhost:3000` in browser.

### Issues

No testing libraries installed at this time.
Possibly other packages are still missing. I haven't gone that in depth in making anything yet.
