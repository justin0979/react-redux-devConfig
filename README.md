## Base setup for React/Redux Frontend with Webpack-Dev-Server

### Purpose
Auto refresh browser on saves.

### Why?
Because this configuration is faster than `npx create-react-app .` on my slow internet.
And, I can add whatever I need as I go along.
### Start
run `npm i`
then `npm start`
then go to `localhost:3000` in browser.
### Issues
No testing libraries installed at this time.
Just made this,so I haven't tried class components yet. Will Probably need to `npm i -D @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties`
